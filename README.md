## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

2. Set up the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The backend server will start at http://localhost:8000

3. Set up the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend development server will start at http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Enter your text in the textarea
3. Click "Analyze Content"
4. Review the highlighted issues and suggestions
5. Use the improved text version if desired

### Example Input
```text
The form cannot be utilized until it has been completed by the applicant. The DMDC will implement new regulations that should not be ignored. The CIA and FBI agents will commence and terminate the investigation. The documents were being processed when the error occurred.
```

This sample text contains multiple style issues:
- Passive voice: "has been completed", "were being processed"
- Complex words: "utilized", "implement", "commence", "terminate"
- Undefined abbreviations: "DMDC", "CIA", "FBI"
- Phrases that could use contractions: "cannot", "will not", "should not"

### Expected Output
![Example Output](docs/images/example-output.png)

## Style Checks

The application currently checks for:

1. **Passive Voice**
   - Identifies common passive voice constructions
   - Suggests using active voice instead
   - Example: "has been completed" â†’ "completed"

2. **Abbreviations**
   - Flags undefined abbreviations
   - Allows common abbreviations (e.g., US, FAQ)
   - Suggests defining abbreviations on first use
   - Example: "DMDC" â†’ "Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)"

3. **Complex Words**
   - Identifies overly complex words
   - Suggests simpler alternatives
   - Examples:
     - "utilize" â†’ "use"
     - "implement" â†’ "start"
     - "facilitate" â†’ "help"
     - "leverage" â†’ "use"
     - "commence" â†’ "begin"
     - "terminate" â†’ "end"

4. **Contractions**
   - Identifies phrases that could use contractions
   - Makes content more conversational
   - Examples:
     - "cannot" â†’ "can't"
     - "will not" â†’ "won't"
     - "should not" â†’ "shouldn't"
     - "do not" â†’ "don't"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Backend Server Won't Start**
   - Error: "Address already in use"
     ```
     Solution: Kill the process using port 8000
     lsof -i :8000 | grep LISTEN
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - Error: "Module not found"
     ```
     Solution: Ensure you're in the virtual environment
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Frontend Development Server Issues**
   - Error: "Module not found"
     ```
     Solution: Clear npm cache and reinstall
     npm cache clean --force
     rm -rf node_modules
     npm install
     ```
   - Error: "TypeScript errors"
     ```
     Solution: Check TypeScript version compatibility
     npm install typescript@4.9.5 --save-dev
     ```

3. **CORS Issues**
   - Error: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin missing"
     ```
     Solution: Ensure backend CORS middleware is properly configured
     Check main.py for correct CORS settings
     ```

4. **Node Version Issues**
   - Solution: Use nvm to install correct Node version
     ```bash
     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
     source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
     nvm install 14.15.0
     nvm use 14.15.0
     ```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Backend**
   - Use gunicorn for production deployment
   - Enable uvicorn workers
   ```bash
   gunicorn app.main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
   ```

2. **Frontend**
   - Create production build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Serve with nginx or similar

```

### Adding New Style Checks

To add new style checks:

1. Add a new check function in `backend/app/main.py`
   ```python
   def check_new_style(text: str) -> List[ContentIssue]:
       # Implementation
       pass
   ```

2. Update the `analyze_content` endpoint to include the new check
   ```python
   issues.extend(check_new_style(text))
   ```

3. Add corresponding styling in the frontend's `getIssueColor` function
   ```typescript
   case 'new_style':
     return 'green';
   ```

4. Update this documentation
